Before proceeding, make sure your computer has [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. See [these instructions](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/environment) to set up an environment for Ionic.

Install the Ionic CLI with npm:

- npm install -g @ionic/cli

If there was a previous installation of the Ionic CLI, it will need to be uninstalled due to a change in package name.

- $ npm uninstall -g ionic
- $ npm install -g @ionic/cli
